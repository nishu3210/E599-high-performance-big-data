IndyCar - Resolving latency issues of the message flow and implementing the data persistence layer

The task is to benchmark and suggest a message broker service to facilitate the transfer of data from the race event (coming from differnet sensors) to the server.

Implement a data persistence layer which will capture this data and further store it to be used for analysis.
